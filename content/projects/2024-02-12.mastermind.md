![A completed game of Mastermind](/images/projects/microcontroller-success.jpg)

This is a page about
my final project for ECE 3710: Microcontrollers.
You can find the source code
on GitHub [here](https://github.com/CodeTriangle/ece3710-final).

This project,
written by myself and a lab partner,
implements a digital version
of the classic 2-player board game
[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))
for an STM32 microcontroller
in C and assembly.

It requires:
* an [STM32L476RG](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32l476rg.html) microcontroller
* a 16x16 pixel WS2812B LED array
* six push buttons
  (as currently written,
  the code assumes they will be
  red, yellow, green, blue, orange, and purple,
  in that order)

This project was a lot of fun to work on
because of how many topics
I was able to touch on
while working on it.
I created what is essentially
a very low-level device driver
and basic graphics API
for drawing to the LED array.

The WS2812B chip is actually very well supported
by various LED libraries,
notably [FastLED](https://fastled.io/),
which every website I went to for help
suggested I use.
I would have simply used this
if the class hadn't been focused
on interfacing with
a microcontroller's memory map directly
rather than relying on libraries
such as Arduino
(which FastLED depends on).

We considered other options
for LED arrays,
such as [this one from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/607).
They helpfully proclaim,
> Of course, we wouldn't leave you
> with a datasheet and a "good luck!"
> We have tutorials and add-on boards
> that will make connecting and usage very easy!

Again, since none of these tutorials
would work with our environment,
I decided to look at that datasheet
that they mentioned.
The datasheet, however,
includes no mention
of the protocol
required to control the thing
other than that it uses 13 pins.
In reality, the folks at Adafruit
left me with no datasheet and a "good luck."
I spent only a couple of hours
searching for information
before I decided that the WS2812B,
whose datasheet was obtuse but existent,
would probably be a better choice.

Nontrivial effort was required
to decipher the WS2812B's datasheet.
When I finally did,
I realized that communicating with the thing
would be a tall task indeed.

The WS2812B chip requires
a 5-volt wire,
a ground wire,
and a data-in signal.
It produces a data-out signal,
which can be wired to another WS2812B chip.
In order to not use a clock,
the WS2812B chip interprets the logic HIGH
and logic LOW signals
on the data-in line
in specific ways
over specific absolute time intervals
as zeroes and ones,
forming a sequence of three eight-bit numbers,
which are used as the intensity
of the green, red, and blue LEDs,
in that order.
All bits following the initial 24 received
are sent on to the next light in the chain.

In particular,
each bit takes 1.25&mu;s &pm; 600ns
to transmit.
Each bit begins
at logic HIGH,
and the amount of time
the line is held
at logic HIGH
determines whether the bit
is a zero or one.

| Time High | Time Low | Bit Sent |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|400ns &pm; 150ns | 850ns &pm; 150ns | 0
|800ns &pm; 150ns | 450ns &pm; 150ns | 1

Holding the line at logic LOW for 50&mu;s
resets the display
the next time the line is pulled to logic HIGH.

To figure out just how fast
I would need to drive this thing,
I wrote a simple python script
to calculate the minimum
and maximum amount
of clock cycles
that would comprise
each of the different windows:

```python
T0H = 0.40e-6
T1H = 0.80e-6
T0L = 0.85e-6
T1L = 0.45e-6

margin = 150e-9

for spd in [4e6, 8e6, 16e6, 24e6, 32e6, 48e6, 64e6, 80e6]:
    print(f"TIMINGS FOR SPEED={int(spd)}")
    print(f"{'goal':>8}{'min':>10}{'max':>10}{'minclk':>10}{'maxclk':>10}")
    for t in [T0H, T0L, T1H, T1L]:
        mini=t-margin;
        maxi=t+margin;
        print(f"{t:8}{mini:10.2}{maxi:10.2}{mini*spd:10.2f}{maxi*spd:10.2f}")

    print()
```

Turns out, hitting these windows
on the chip we had
is no joke.
At the default clock speed of 4 MHz,
the maximum time for the shortest interval
is 2.2 clock cycles,
which is not remotely possible to hit.

| Goal (ns) | Min time (ns) | Max time (ns) | Min time (clock cycles) | Max time (clock cycles) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 400 |  250 |  550 |  1.00 |  2.20 |
| 850 |  700 | 1000 |  2.80 |  4.00 |
| 800 |  649 |  950 |  2.60 |  3.80 |
| 450 |  300 |  600 |  1.20 |  2.40 |

The windows only begin to be slightly forgiving at 32 MHz,
where the maximum time for the shortest interval
is 17.6 clock cycles:

| Goal (ns) | Min time (ns) | Max time (ns) | Min time (clock cycles) | Max time (clock cycles) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 400 |  250 |  550 |  8.00 | 17.60 |
| 850 |  700 | 1000 | 22.40 | 32.00 |
| 800 |  649 |  950 | 20.80 | 30.40 |
| 450 |  300 |  600 |  9.60 | 19.20 |

I fiddled around for a few hours
creating a C procedure,
but the exact length
of the compiler's code
in clock cycles
was just too unpredictable.

So I had to go one step further
and write an optimized assembly procedure.
I'll spare you the exact details,
but I was able to hit the timing intervals
with the 32 MHz clock
with a few clock cycles to spare, even.
At a few points,
I had to insert no-op instructions
to get to the approximate center
of the timing window.

Once I had the code
communicating with the LEDs,
it was time to start defining my API.
The first thing to do
was set up all the different colors.
They went through several variations,
but the final colors are defined as follows:

```c
#define BLACK  0
#define RED    1
#define YELLOW 2
#define BLUE   3
#define GREEN  4
#define PURPLE 5
#define ORANGE 6
#define WHITE  7

static uint8_t colors[8][3] = {
    //            GRN   RED   BLU
    [BLACK]  = { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 },
    [WHITE]  = { 0x10, 0x10, 0x10 },
    [RED]    = { 0x00, 0x20, 0x00 },
    [GREEN]  = { 0x2A, 0x00, 0x03 },
    [BLUE]   = { 0x0A, 0x00, 0x2A },
    [YELLOW] = { 0x25, 0x2A, 0x00 },
    [PURPLE] = { 0x00, 0x15, 0x20 },
    [ORANGE] = { 0x08, 0x35, 0x00 },
};
```

Note that the highest value
in the entire array
is `0x2A`.
These lights burn *bright* at full intensity.
Even at half intensity,
it can hurt to look at the board too long.
Only by bumping everything down
to a sixth of the maximum value
is it possible to look at these LEDs
at relatively close range.

After that,
it was simply a matter
of decoding the snaking pattern
that the data line followed
to get screen coordinates,
then writing a function to set a pixel.
Further drawing functions
were out of scope of the assignment,
but drawing lines,
circles,
and other objects
with only the aid of a pixel setting function
is a well-explored field;
thus its implementation
is left as an exercise
to the reader.
The `set_pixel` function
is included below:

```c
void set_pixel(
    uint8_t *image,
    const uint8_t x,
    const uint8_t y,
    const uint8_t color,
) {
    uint8_t yoffset = x % 2 ? (15 - y) : y;
    uint8_t xoffset = (15 - x) * 16;
    uint8_t idx = xoffset + yoffset;

    image[idx] = color;
}
```

`image` is a buffer of 256 eight-bit integers,
each representing a color in the `colors` array
included in the snippet above the last.
These are turned into
their corresponding three-byte representations,
which are sent to the array at the end.

The rest of the project including
the button interface,
the microcontroller initialization,
and the game logic
were interesting to implement
but they were not novel for me
so I won't go over any of it here.
