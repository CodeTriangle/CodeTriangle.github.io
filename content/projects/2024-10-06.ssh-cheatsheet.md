Many years ago,
I gave a presentation
for the Free Software and Linux Club
at Utah State University
teaching people how to use SSH.
Specifically, I chose to emphasize
the use of the OpenSSH client.
I truly believe that SSH
and, in particular OpenSSH,
is one of the most powerful tools
available to you
as a computer user
(not just as a Linux user).

At the time, I had been using SSH
for several years,
but I had had a rough start with the tool
and it took me a good while
to learn all of its secrets
and how to use it well.
I saw the presentation
as a great opportunity
to give new users
the opportunity to learn in just over an hour
what had taken me many years to figure out.

I decided to make a little handout
to go along with the presentation,
to ease the audience into the concepts
and to give them as reminders
in case they forgot the syntax.
However, I also ended up receiving feedback
from seasoned users
who ended up referencing my cheatsheet
for some of the more obscure features.

As the years have gone by,
the presentation has gotten even longer
as I've learned more about SSH myself.
This year,
I decided to redesign my handout
in Inkscape
(the previous version was just a LaTeX document).
I am extremely proud of how it turned out
so I decided to share it here.
I hope it is relevant and useful
for years to come.

A printable PDF version is also available
with two copies side-by-side
on a piece of letter paper.
[You can find it here](/documents/ssh-cheatsheet-two.pdf).

I have decided to distribute this
under Creative Commons 4.0 BY,
the least restrictive one.
The cheatsheet's source
and distributions
are available
at the following GitHub repo:
