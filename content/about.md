title: About This Blog
---

Hey there!
I'm Richard, or CodeTriangle, or Trungle, or Trongle,
depending on where you know me from.
Welcome to my blog,
my largely unfocused collection
of thoughts and opinions
on anything and everything
that may interest me.

While the full contents of this blog
will only be interesting to me,
there are reasons other people
might want to visit.
The authoratative version
of some of my opinions
will be stored here,
and this blog will allow me
to link people to them
quickly and easily.

I may at some point write
with some amount of specificity
about the different categories
that this blog will cover,
but that day is not today.
For now, here's a short list
of things I'm interested in,
which may or may not be featured
on this site in the future:

* Systems programming
* Software minimalism
* Unix-like operating systems
* Text editing
* Text encoding
* Microcontrollers
* Nintendo games and consoles
* Indie games
* Competitive Splatoon
* The works of Brandon Sanderson
* Animation
